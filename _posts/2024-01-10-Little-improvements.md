Hello! first post back from Christmas and the new year! 
I thought in this time to improve my website by adding a Favicon and Apple touch Icon 
<img src="/public/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed.png">

The Favicon help users more easily identify your website on their browser navigation bar, while the apple touch icon will be displayed when searching for your site on an Apple device.
