title: Workflow managers, Snakemake!
---

This last few weeks I made it my mission to understand a workflow manager. My options seemed to be split between a consensus of Nextflow and Snakemake. Coming to the conclusion that Snakemake would be the better choice considering my previous experience with Python compared to Nextflow, which is built in Groovy/(which is a dialect of Java/). 

From there I worked to complete the advanced and basic tutorials for Snakemake. From which I am very impressed! The layers of reproducibilty and reliability that it provides is very impressive. 

Furthermore it has introduced me to Pixi. An alternative package manager to Conda, that boasts of being [up to 10x faster than Mamba when installing and resolving an environment from scratch](https://prefix.dev/blog/pixi_a_fast_conda_alternative). As well as a host of other benefits mentioned in the article hyperlinked above.

I look forward to applying Snakemake and Pixi in my future projects!
