Hello, I'm Sam Beales a recent Master's in Immunobiology and Bioinformatics graduate looking into working in bioinformatics. To help I've decided to try my hand at developing my own personal website. These posts will follow my progress and hopefully provide a follow on for others who would like to develop their own personal sites.
